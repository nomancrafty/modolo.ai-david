/* ============================================================
   Seven AI Employees — the road and its seven exits.

   Every lead is a driver on the same road; there are seven exits where they
   leave before reaching the front door. Each chapter is one exit: the moment
   in the customer's own words, the narrative, a stats/callouts panel, and a
   full-width "Exit closed by" banner naming the AI employee that closes it.

   Data-driven: each exit is a record in EXITS, and the callouts panel renders
   from a typed list of blocks so every chapter reuses the same components.
   All copy is the client's, verbatim.
